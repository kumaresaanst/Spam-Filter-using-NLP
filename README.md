# Spam-Filter-using-NLP

Predicted the Ham and spam messages using Naive Bayes Text Classifier, aided by DTM converter Count Vectorizer Library.
Also figure out the effect of spam on unique words in the data. 

I have figured out false positives and negatives of the classification using Confusion matrix.

This problem can also be approached using NLTK Library and documentation. 

Thanks
